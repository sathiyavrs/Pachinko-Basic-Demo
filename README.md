My implementation of Pachinko using Unity while learning bits and peices of Unity's physics engine :D

Pretty Simple stuff really.

# To Play

Clone the repository onto your desktop.

On Windows, run Game_2.exe

Use the WebGL version to run the browser friendly version;

Note: To run the WebGL version, perform the following
* Clone Project onto your device.
* Run a Python SimpleHTTPServer on the 'WebGL Version' folder.
* Use your browser to open that particular LocalHost.

Optimization Problems currently with the WebGL Version for some reason. Oh yeah, and browsers which don't support WebGL will not be able to run the WebGL Version. Chromium is one such example.

Cheers!


# Controls

R to restart the game (Can be done at any time).

Space to launch the projectile.
