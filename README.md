# Pachinko Basic Demo
My implementation of Pachinko using Unity while learning bits and peices of Unity's physics engine :D

Pretty Simple stuff really.

# To Play

Clone the repository onto your desktop.

On Windows, run Game_2.exe

Use the WebGL version to run the browser friendly version;

Note: To run the WebGL version, perform the following
* Clone Project onto your device.
* Run a Python SimpleHTTPServer on the 'WebGL Version' folder.
* Use your browser to open that particular LocalHost.

Optimization Problems currently with the WebGL Version for some reason.

Cheers!


# Controls

R to restart the game (Can be done at any time).

Space to launch the projectile.
